Massive Technical Test:

The ultimate goal was to demonstrate my understanding of web technologies and practices.

# Run instructions #
Use ```dotnet run``` in the root directory.
This will install the project dependencies and start the project on ```localhost:5000```.

## Context ##
"You did have all pieces in place to make it work, but it was hard for us to judge how well you understood each part and how they fit together in a good way."

This is a critique from my most recent technical challenge. I was tasked with developing an end to end solution, including UX, frontend, backend + database implementation for a planning poker application that was to update in real time. I completed the project and had a fully functional solution, but the front end (my area of expertise) was heavily compromised as I spent 85% of the time trying to figure out the areas I didn't know - the backend, database and hosting and real time clientside updates.

With this in mind I didn't want to repeat my mistake. I completely forwent developing a backend as I knew,realistically, that I would end up with nothing to be proud of. 

## Technologies ##
* React for the frontend.
* Reactstrap for modals
* CSS. 
* Create-react-app with dotnet for boilerplate.
* SwaggerUI for API design
* Dotnet core web api 

## If I had more time ##

* Proper validation for forms
* Proper user login with firebase.io or c# - hashing passwords, https, jwt tokens etc.
* More modular and reusable react components.
* Unit testing with enzyme and jest
* Deployed to an online hosting service such as heroku
* Integrate with a proper backend, mongodb / mongoose ODM and hosted on the cloud with mlabs.
* Prop drilling with some props (solved with the React Context api)
* Learning c# would have been fun.

## Process ##
I wanted to use as little boilerplate and boostrapping as possible, I also wanted to show modular coding practices, linting,
